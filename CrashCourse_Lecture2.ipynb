    "Enforcing structure to minimise overfitting is called *regularisation*. Techniques such as *bagging* or *bootstrap* methods that we saw in the previous lecture are examples of randomised approaches to regularisation.

For many problems, the underlying space of variations is very limited and even if there is a huge vector of measurements, they all belong to a very small subspace. \n",

Simple approaches like PCA can often find subspaces which contain much of the feature space needed for classifcation and ignore the irrelevant variables."

    "There is one very useful property of a high-dimensional space. If $d$ (the number of dimensions in a dataset) is at least $n-1$ for $n$ samples, and the $d$ are independent, then we can **always** draw a linear decision boundary which divides any portion of the samples from any other portion.\n",

    "In other words, we can *always* find a linear classifier that separates the data however we want.\n",

    "A simple way to acheive this is to replace the original feature space with distances from every point in the dataset. So if we have a $n \\times d$ matrix of features $X$, we can replace this with a new matrix $K$ of size $n \\times n$, where each row $X_i$ is the distance of sample $i$ to all the other samples in the original feature space. This rewriting of the samples as inter-distances is the *kernel* method.\n",
