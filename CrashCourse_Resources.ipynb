    "* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), which provides a rich data type for manipulating numerical data, with named columns and rows, sophisticated joining and grouping and I/O from many kinds of files and databases.\n",
    "* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), which provides 2D graphing functionality, including scatterplots, histograms, pseudo-color maps, and more.\n",
    "* [SymPy](http://sympy.org), which adds symbolic algebra to Python (and can for example do expression simplification, series expansion, and so on)\n",
    "* [IPython](http://ipython.org), the interactive notebook tool you are using right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other handy packages\n",
    "\n",
    "* [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) provides clustering, preprocessing (e.g. patch extraction), classification (e.g. SVM), meta-classifiers (bagging/boosting) and validation/testing tools (cross-validation, ROC curves)\n",
    "* [mdp](http://mdp-toolkit.sourceforge.net/) provides low-dimensional projection and independent component analysis tools (PCA, LLE, ISOMAP, RBM)\n",
    "* [theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) provides GPU accelerated Numpy, as well as automatic differentiation and other tools handy in deep learning.\n",
    "* [pyMC](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/) is a powerful MCMC library, which can set up MCMC samplers from a simple specification, run them and produce sophisticated diagnostics. Includes a powerful Gaussian Process module, which can be used in MCMC runs.\n",
    "* [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/) Statistical models, hypothesis testing, regression and estimators.\n",
    "* [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/) provides scientific image manipulation tools.\n",
    "* [opencv](http://opencv.org/) provides video access and a rich set of image processing operations (contour extraction, morphological ops, motion tracking, etc.)\n",
    "* [cython](http:/www.cython.org) Write pseudo-Python which compiles to very fast C modules, seamless integration with standard Python. Ideal for writing optimised inner-loops.\n",
    "* [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) The python natural langauge processing toolkit, including part-of-speech tagging, tokenisers, parse tree generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specialised packages\n",
    "* [GPy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GPy) Flexible Gaussian Processes for Python.\n",
    "* [tSNE](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tsne/0.1) Stochastic neighbour embedding, for low-dimensional visualisation. "
